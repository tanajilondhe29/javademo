Creating Tags

Git uses two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated.

A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change – it’s just a pointer to a specific commit.

Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed; 
contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). 
It’s generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you can have all this information; 
but if you want a temporary tag or for some reason don’t want to keep the other information, lightweight tags are available too.

Annotated Tags
Creating an annotated tag in Git is simple. The easiest way is to specify -a when you run the tag command:

$ git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"
$ git tag
v0.1
v1.3
v1.4

Lightweight Tags
Another way to tag commits is with a lightweight tag. This is basically the commit checksum stored in a file – no other information is kept. To create a lightweight tag, don’t supply the -a, -s, or -m option:

$ git tag v1.4-lw
$ git tag
v0.1
v1.3
v1.4
v1.4-lw
v1.5
